# Specify the disk to monitor
# Should be sda

#WDANTIPARKD_DISK=sda


# Specify the interval between checks for disk activity
# Normally WD drives, you want to specify 7 seconds since the
# heads park after 8 seconds of inactivity. If you were able
# to extend the idle count to 25s, then 24 is a better value here.

#WDANTIPARKD_INTERVAL=7


# Minimum number of seconds for ANTIPARK timeout. The ANTIPARK
# timeout is the number of seconds of read inactivity before
# allowing the disk head to be PARKED. For example, if 60 seconds is
# specified, then must wait for one minute without read activity
# before allowing the head to park.

#WDANTIPARKD_ANTIPARK_TIMEOUT=60


# Maximum number of seconds for ANTIPARK timeout.

#WDANTIPARKD_ANTIPARK_TIMEOUT_MAX=300


# Number of seconds for the PARKED timeout.

# Specify a file on the filesystem which wdantiparkd will write
# to in order to keep the disk head from parking

#WDANTIPARKD_ANTIPARK_TEMP_FILE=/tmp/wdantiparkd.tmp


# Sync disks before switching to IDLE mode.
# This ensures that disk buffers are updated before entering
# IDLE mode. Ofcourse, syncing disks will increase the LLC count
# by 1 each time. This is false by default.

# By default, logging is disabled. But if you want to see the stats,
# you might want to enable logging.
